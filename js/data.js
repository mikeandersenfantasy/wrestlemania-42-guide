    whyItMatters: "The <strong>first-ever singles match</strong> between two of the most physically dominant women in WWE history. Jade Cargill has been nearly unbeatable with a 7-month championship streak. Rhea Ripley is the most popular woman in WWE and a former two-time champion. Their social media warfare has blurred the lines between real and scripted, with both women claiming to be \"That Bitch.\" This is a collision of power vs. power with the Women's Championship on the line.",
    storySoFar: "Rhea Ripley earned her title shot by dominating the 2026 Women's Elimination Chamber in Chicago, finishing the match with a devastating Riptide. She immediately set her sights on Jade Cargill's WWE Women's Championship. Their face-to-face confrontation on SmackDown was electric -- both women refused to back down, with Jade insisting she's the most dominant champion in WWE and Rhea firing back that she's <em>\"coming to take what's hers.\"</em> Social media has only added fuel to the fire, with both claiming to be \"That Bitch.\"",
